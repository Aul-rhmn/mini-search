#  Mini Search — Full-Stack Developer Take-Home Task (Task A)

A compact **full-stack search application** built with **Next.js 16 (App Router)**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to search through a local JSON dataset and view the top matching results based on keyword relevance.

---

##  Objective

Develop a minimal yet functional **search UI** that interacts with a backend API route.  
The app retrieves the top matches from a local dataset and displays them dynamically with loading and empty states.
